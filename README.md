# SIP-metagenomic analysis of cell and viral enrichment from Siders pond

## All the data and code needed to analysis the metagenomic data from DNA-SIP incubations of Siders pond sample

# Summary
 Viruses impact aquatic biogeochemistry via host cell lysis and rewiring host metabolic processes. However, their functional role in aquatic dark carbon cycling is mostly unexplored. Here, we established a method to identify active viruses targeting primary producers (chemoautotrophs) using $$13^{C}-DNA stable isotopic probing combined with metagenomics.
